```javascript
// pages/about.js
function About() {
  // Check if the environment variable exists before accessing it
  const mySecretVar = process.env.MY_SECRET_VAR || 'Default value';
  console.log(mySecretVar);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.  The secret variable is: {mySecretVar}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default About;
```

**Explanation:**

The solution addresses the problem by using the OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value if `process.env.MY_SECRET_VAR` is not defined.  This prevents the runtime error.  It's crucial to always handle potential undefined environment variables to ensure robustness in production environments.  You should also consider using a more comprehensive solution like a dedicated environment variable management system for better security and organization.
